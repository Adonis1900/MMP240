<h1>Instrements and Vocals.</h1>
<p>Once you have all of these things in tact. Music consists of 5 things, a kick, a snare,
high hats, a melody, and vocals. There can be added instrements, and definitely a little reverb wouldnt hurt nobody. Its gonna be tough learning how to use the piano roll and musical typing if your new to this. If theres any questions check with youtube.</p>
